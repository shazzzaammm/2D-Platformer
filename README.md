This project is an attempt to learn Godot through remaking a game I made in Unity (hopefully it will be better too).
I am going to be watching a lot of tutorials BUT I will try to only watch things that I know nothing/little about.
If I kind of know, I'll at least try before watching a tutorial (like what I had done with player movement).
Please don't use this to learn Godot because I do not know Godot yet :3
